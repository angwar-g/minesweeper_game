# Minesweeper Game

Welcome to the Minesweeper Game! This is a classic Minesweeper game implemented in Python using the Tkinter library.

Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle game. The objective is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them, with the help of clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.

- The number on a revealed cell indicates how many mines are adjacent to that cell.
- The game is won when all non-mine cells are revealed.
- The game is lost if a mine is revealed.
